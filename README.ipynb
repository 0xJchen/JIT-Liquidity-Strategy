    "# Instructions\n",
    "The system is comprised of two components:\n",
    "1. Highly-concurrent Rust service that watches the mempool for pending Uniswap transactions and makes them available via a REST API\n",
    "2. Python dashboard that consumes data from the REST API to display different swap transaction metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, please clone the GitHub repository using the usual command in the terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/oleggolev/JIT-Liquidity-Strategy.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with the system, launch the Rust service in one terminal. Then launch the Python Dashboard to consume the Rust service's data in another terminal. See instructions on how to launch both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching the Rust Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Config\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rust service consumes a `config.yaml` file which specifies its runtime parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top level of the repository, create this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "See an example of a `config.yaml` below:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "provider: infura\n",
    "api_key: <YOUR INFURA KEY HERE>\n",
    "abi_json_path: ./abi\n",
    "tx_retry_times: 2\n",
    "tx_retry_period: 1000\n",
    "api_server_address: 127.0.0.1:8000\n",
    "```\n",
    "`tx_retry_interval` is in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anvil\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rust service forks all contents of an Infura node onto a local Anvil node (similar to Ganache).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Anvil, run the following in the terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\n",
    "brew install libusb\n",
    "foundaryup\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, you will be able to run Anvil using the command-line or as part of this Rust service when using the bash terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cargo run <optional: /path/to/config.yaml>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching the Python Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a different terminal window. First, install the streamlit app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "pip3 install streamlit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then navigate to the location of `script.py` and launch the Dashboard app:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd pysrc\n",
    "streamlit run script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running the last command, a browser window will automatically open, showcasing the Dashboard statistics which will update in real-time as the Rust service continues gathering data about incoming swap transactions."
